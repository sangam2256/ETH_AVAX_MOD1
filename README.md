## Function and Errors Contract

This repository contains a smart contract implementation called `smartContract` that demonstrates the usage of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements in Solidity.

## Smart Contract

The main smart contract in this repository is `assessmentMod1.sol`. It showcases the usage of the following statements:

- **`require()`**: The `require()` statement is used to validate conditions before executing the rest of the function. If any of the conditions are not met, the function will throw an exception with the provided error message.

- **`assert()`**: The `assert()` statement is used to check for internal errors and ensure that certain conditions are always true. If the condition is false, it indicates a bug in the contract, and the transaction will be reverted.

- **`revert()`**: The `revert()` statement is used to explicitly revert the transaction with a specified error message. In the example, if the condition `x > y` is true, the transaction will be reverted with the provided error message.
