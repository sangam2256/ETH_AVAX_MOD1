# SimpleStore Smart Contract

This repository contains a simple Solidity contract called `SimpleStore`, which demonstrates error handling in Solidity using `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements.

## Features

- **`require()`**: Used to validate input conditions before execution, such as checking stock availability and valid purchase quantities.
- **`assert()`**: Ensures internal consistency by verifying post-conditions, like the correct update of stock after a purchase.
- **`revert()`**: Explicitly used to revert transactions when certain conditions are not met, like limiting the purchase quantity.

## Development

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Modify the code or add new features.
3. Write tests and ensure all pass.
4. Commit, push changes, and submit a pull request.
